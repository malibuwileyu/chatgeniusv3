# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Checklist (Using LangChain)

Below is a more detailed breakdown of Steps 1 and 2, including every small task you need for a working RAG MVP, now incorporating LangChain to manage embeddings, vector storage, and context retrieval.

## Step 1: Embed Existing Messages and Store in a Vector Database

1. Prepare the Environment  
   - [x] Ensure you have an OpenAI API key in an environment variable (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).  
   - [x] Obtain the credentials for your vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Supabase Vector).  
   - [x] Confirm these keys are securely stored in environment variables (e.g., PINECONE_API_KEY, PINECONE_ENV, etc.).  

2. Gather Dependencies  
   - [x] Install needed libraries for embeddings, vector storage, and HTTP requests (keeping everything in sync with your final environment): (2024-01-19 15:55 EST)
       • openai (for embeddings)  
       • langchain (for managing embedding calls, vector storage, and retrieval)  
       • axios or node-fetch (for basic HTTP operations, if needed)  
       • pinecone-client (or another vector DB client, depending on your chosen vector store)  
       • pinecone-database (if using the Pinecone service specifically)  
   - [x] Confirm that package.json or your environment's requirements file is updated with these dependencies. (2024-01-19 15:55 EST)

3. Fetch Messages from Your Database  
   - [x] Connect to the application database (via Supabase) (2024-01-19 15:30 EST)
   - [x] Write or refine a function to pull all messages you intend to embed (2024-01-19 15:30 EST)
   - [x] Verify each entry has a unique ID, the relevant text, and important metadata (2024-01-19 15:30 EST)

4. Chunk or Prepare Message Content  
   - [ ] Decide whether messages require splitting. If so, segment longer content into smaller parts.  
   - [ ] If you do use splits, store references to the original message ID in each chunk’s metadata.

5. Generate Embeddings (Using LangChain)  
   - [ ] Set up a LangChain embeddings object tied to your OpenAI credentials.  
   - [ ] For each message (or chunk), retrieve embeddings via LangChain’s pipeline (no extraneous tokens or formatting).  
   - [ ] Keep the returned vectors in memory or a list, ensuring you maintain references to the original message metadata.

6. Upsert Embeddings to the Vector Database  
   - [ ] Connect to your vector store using LangChain’s VectorStore integrations (e.g., a Pinecone instance).  
   - [ ] Make sure you create or reference the correct index/namespace as required.  
   - [ ] Insert or upsert each item, providing the vector, unique ID, and original text or metadata.

7. Validate the Upsert  
   - [ ] Query your vector DB (via LangChain or your chosen library) for random items.  
   - [ ] Ensure you get the correct matches, and that your dataset count matches your expectation.

8. Keep the Script Maintained  
   - [ ] Save your embedding or indexing script (e.g., embedMessages.js or embedMessages.py) with clear documentation about usage.  
   - [ ] Schedule or plan a process to re-embed new messages or updates periodically.

## Step 2: Query the Vector Database and Generate an LLM Answer

1. Create an “Ask” or “Search” Endpoint in Your Backend  
   - [ ] Expose a new route (e.g., POST /api/ask) to receive user queries.  
   - [ ] Enforce any required auth or rate-limiting rules.

2. Embed the User’s Query (Using LangChain)  
   - [ ] Use the same embeddings object from Step 1 to embed the user input.  
   - [ ] Keep the pipeline consistent with your earlier configuration so embeddings match.

3. Perform a Similarity Search in the Vector DB  
   - [ ] Request the most relevant chunks using the similarity search methods (top K, etc.).  
   - [ ] Return or collect the text and metadata for inclusion in the LLM prompt.

4. Construct a Prompt for the LLM  
   - [ ] Combine retrieved content into a “context block.”  
   - [ ] Append the user’s query after that context, ensuring the AI sees the relevant background.  
   - [ ] If using chat-based requests, structure them accordingly; otherwise, keep it a single prompt string.

5. Send the Prompt to OpenAI (Using LangChain)  
   - [ ] Provide any model parameters (model name, temperature, max tokens).  
   - [ ] Use your LangChain chain or direct LLM calls to process the combined context and user question.

6. Parse and Return the Answer  
   - [ ] Extract the full text from the LLM’s response.  
   - [ ] Return it as JSON (e.g., { answer: "..." }) to the calling UI or service.  
   - [ ] Handle any errors or fallback paths gracefully.

7. Integrate into Your UI  
   - [ ] In the client (frontend), create or update a function to call /api/ask with the user’s query.  
   - [ ] Display the returned answer.  
   - [ ] Provide loading states or error messages as needed.

8. Confirm End-to-End Works  
   - [ ] Start your full stack and test a query that should retrieve known context.  
   - [ ] Check logs for errors.  
   - [ ] Confirm that the references in the final answer align with the embedded data.

9. (Optional) Further Optimizations  
   - [ ] Add caching, re-ranking, or advanced prompt engineering if you see repeated queries.  
   - [ ] Consider strategies for chunk overlap or dynamic query expansion.  
   - [ ] Explore advanced LangChain features (memory objects, custom chains, etc.) as your app grows in complexity.
