# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Checklist (Using LangChain)

Below is a more detailed breakdown of Steps 1 and 2, including every small task you need for a working RAG MVP, now incorporating LangChain to manage embeddings, vector storage, and context retrieval.

## Step 1: Embed Existing Messages and Store in a Vector Database

1. Prepare the Environment  
   - [x] Ensure you have an OpenAI API key in an environment variable (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY). (2024-03-19 14:30 EST)
   - [x] Obtain the credentials for your vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Supabase Vector). (2024-03-19 14:31 EST)
   - [x] Confirm these keys are securely stored in environment variables (e.g., PINECONE_API_KEY, PINECONE_ENV, etc.). (2024-03-19 14:32 EST)

2. Gather Dependencies  
   - [x] Install needed libraries for embeddings, vector storage, and HTTP requests (keeping everything in sync with your final environment):
       • openai (for embeddings) (2024-03-19 14:33 EST)
       • langchain (for managing embedding calls, vector storage, and retrieval) (2024-03-19 14:34 EST)
       • node-fetch (for basic HTTP operations) (2024-03-19 14:35 EST)
       • pinecone-client (@pinecone-database/pinecone) (2024-03-19 14:36 EST)
       • @langchain/pinecone (for Pinecone integration with LangChain) (2024-03-19 14:36 EST)
   - [x] Confirm that package.json or your environment's requirements file is updated with these dependencies. (2024-03-19 14:37 EST)

3. Fetch Messages from Your Database  
   - [x] Connect to the application database (via Supabase) (2024-03-19 14:38 EST)
   - [x] Write or refine a function to pull all messages you intend to embed (2024-03-19 14:38 EST)
   - [x] Verify each entry has a unique ID, the relevant text, and important metadata (2024-03-19 14:38 EST)

4. Chunk or Prepare Message Content  
   - [x] Decide whether messages require splitting. If so, segment longer content into smaller parts. (2024-03-19 14:39 EST)
   - [x] If you do use splits, store references to the original message ID in each chunk's metadata. (2024-03-19 14:39 EST)

5. Generate Embeddings (Using LangChain)  
   - [x] Set up a LangChain embeddings object tied to your OpenAI credentials. (2024-03-19 14:40 EST)
   - [x] For each message (or chunk), retrieve embeddings via LangChain's pipeline (no extraneous tokens or formatting). (2024-03-19 14:40 EST)
   - [x] Keep the returned vectors in memory or a list, ensuring you maintain references to the original message metadata. (2024-03-19 14:40 EST)

6. Upsert Embeddings to the Vector Database  
   - [x] Connect to your vector store using LangChain's VectorStore integrations (e.g., a Pinecone instance). (2024-03-19 14:41 EST)
   - [x] Make sure you create or reference the correct index/namespace as required. (2024-03-19 14:41 EST)
   - [x] Insert or upsert each item, providing the vector, unique ID, and original text or metadata. (2024-03-19 14:41 EST)

7. Validate the Upsert  
   - [x] Query your vector DB (via LangChain or your chosen library) for random items. (2024-03-19 14:42 EST)
   - [x] Ensure you get the correct matches, and that your dataset count matches your expectation. (2024-03-19 14:42 EST)

8. Keep the Script Maintained  
   - [x] Save the embedding script for future use (2024-01-15 19:45 EST)
   - [x] Schedule a process to re-embed new messages or updates periodically (2024-01-15 19:55 EST)
     Plan for Re-embedding Process (To be implemented during Step 2):
     1. Add a last_embedded_at timestamp column to the messages table

## Phase 2: Query the Vector Database and Generate an LLM Answer

1. Create an "Ask" or "Search" Endpoint in Your Backend  
   - [x] Expose a new route (e.g., POST /api/ask) to receive user queries. (2024-01-15 20:15 EST)
   - [x] Enforce any required auth or rate-limiting rules. (2024-01-15 20:15 EST)

2. Embed the User's Query (Using LangChain)  
   - [x] Embed the user's query (using LangChain) (2024-01-15 20:25 EST)
   - [x] Keep the pipeline consistent with earlier configuration (2024-01-15 21:00 EST)

3. Perform a Similarity Search in the Vector DB  
   - [x] Task 1: Request the most relevant chunks using similarity search methods (2024-01-15 20:45 EST)
   - [x] Task 2: Construct a prompt for the LLM using the retrieved chunks (2024-03-19 16:15 EST)

4. Construct a Prompt for the LLM  
   - [x] Task 1: Combine retrieved content into a "context block" (2024-03-19 16:30 EST)
   - [x] Task 2: Append the user's query after that context, ensuring the AI sees the relevant background (2024-03-19 16:30 EST)
   - [x] Task 3: Structure the prompt for chat-based requests (2024-03-19 16:30 EST)

5. Send the Prompt to OpenAI (Using LangChain)  
   - [x] Task 1: Provide model parameters (model name, temperature, max tokens) (2024-03-19 16:45 EST)
   - [x] Task 2: Use LangChain chain or direct LLM calls to process the combined context and user question (2024-03-19 16:45 EST)

6. Parse and Return the Answer  
   - [x] Extract the full text from the LLM's response. (2024-03-19 17:00 EST)
   - [x] Return it as JSON (e.g., { answer: "..." }) to the calling UI or service. (2024-03-19 17:15 EST)
   - [x] Handle errors or fallback paths gracefully (2024-03-19 16:45 EST) 

7. Implement Continuous Re-embedding Process
   - [x] Add last_embedded_at timestamp column to messages table (2024-03-19 17:00 EST)
   - [x] Update embedMessages.js to track and use last embedding timestamp (2024-03-19 17:05 EST)
   - [x] Set up 5-minute cron job for checking and embedding new messages (2024-03-19 17:15 EST)
   - [x] Implement monitoring and alerts for embedding process (2024-03-19 17:20 EST)
   - [x] Test re-embedding with new messages before UI integration (2024-03-19 17:45 EST)

8. Integrate into Your UI  
   - [x] Create AI user and automatic DM setup (2024-03-19 18:00 EST)
   - [x] Add channel settings for AI access (2024-03-19 18:00 EST)
   - [ ] In the client (frontend), create or update a function to call /api/ask with the user's query.  
   - [ ] Display the returned answer.  
   - [ ] Provide loading states or error messages as needed.

9. Confirm End-to-End Works  
   - [ ] Start your full stack and test a query that should retrieve known context.  
   - [ ] Check logs for errors.  
   - [ ] Confirm that the references in the final answer align with the embedded data.

10. (Optional) Further Optimizations  
    - [ ] Add caching, re-ranking, or advanced prompt engineering if you see repeated queries.  
    - [ ] Consider strategies for chunk overlap or dynamic query expansion.  
    - [ ] Explore advanced LangChain features (memory objects, custom chains, etc.) as your app grows in complexity.
